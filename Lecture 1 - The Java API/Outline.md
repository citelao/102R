# The Java API, Outline

## Abstract

These are the accompanying notes for the presentation on the Java API.

They are ordered in the same way I will present in class, and should match fairly well the Presentation.

## Intro

- Java is class-based
	- everything is a class
- Java likes to do things for you
	- default classes
		- Math
		- ArrayList
- You've written your own
	- custom classes
		- TODO what
- How do you use classes?
	- `import java.lang.Math;`
- duh but, like, know how to use
	- something called the API
		- "Application Programming Interface"
		- *specification* of how a system should work
		- => documentation of classes
- I want to teach you how to use the API

## Packages & Classes

- `import java.lang.Math;`
- `java.lang`?
	- package name
	- what's a package
		- lots and lots of classes
		- like folders!
		- in fact, has to match folder structure or Eclipse gets mad
			- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8310518/dont-packages-have-to-match-the-subdirectories-the-java-file-is-in
- `Math`?
	- class name
	- we could use StackOverflow to figure it out
		- stackoverflow ftw
	- but come on; help me help you:
	- let's look this up in the API
	- http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html

## Where is the API

## Reading the API

### Important things

- if you're not gonna pay attention for the rest of class, listen now:
- important things:
	- class name
	- package name
	- => `import {package name}.{class name};`
	- summary
		- what the class does
	- methods
		- how to do it

### Bit by bit

## Why use it?

- The Java API helps you understand complex parts of the system
	- it links to a lot 

## How to use it?

There's a lot here.

### Most important stuff

- name
- package
- summary
